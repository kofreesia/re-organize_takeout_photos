To do: 

Organize downloaded Google Takeout photos, rename each file with a prefix of its taken year, and separate videos or photos into different folders.

Explanation:

The exported Google photos were split into multiple files due to size limitations. It appears like: "takeout001.zip", "takeout002.zip", etc in one "Takeout" folder.

The following steps are what I've done to organize these files:

1. Unzip ".zip" files, this will generate files into their corresponding year folders.

2. Delete unwanted files, i.e., xxx.json in a folder. # If upload these photos onto the server, it is better to keep these JSON files for timeline purposes.

3. Rename files by adding photo-taken-year in front of each photo file.

4. Move the ".mp4" files into the "videos" folder and the ".jpg" files into the "photo" folder.
